= Demo Policies

These are policies that my ficticious company "TofuOrg" wants to ensure are applied consistently to our OpenShift Kubernetes environments.

These policies have an annotation `policy.open-cluster-management.io/standards: TofuOrg-Standards` to group them in the ACM console.

.Be sure to see more example policies
* <https://github.com/stolostron/policy-collection>
* <https://github.com/SimonDelord/ACM-Templates/tree/master/resources12>

== Deploy

Each of these policies will be applied to the "local-cluster" (ACM hub) by deploying the link:../apps/demo-acm-policies[demo-acm-policies] app in this repo.

[source,bash]
oc apply -k apps/demo-acm-policies
oc get subscriptions -n demo-acm-policies
