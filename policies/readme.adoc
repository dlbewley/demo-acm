= Demo Policies

These are policies that ficticious company "TofuOrg" wants to ensure are applied consistently to our OpenShift Kubernetes environments.

These policies have an annotation `policy.open-cluster-management.io/standards: TofuOrg-Standards` to group them in the ACM console.

.Simplify Resource to Policy Generation
[TIP]
The https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.4/html/governance/governance#policy-generator[policy generator] plugin for Kustomize may be used to build configuration management policies from Kubernetes manifests.
